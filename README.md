# Image-Caption-Generator
This project showcases an AI-based Image Caption Generator that automatically describes the content of an image using deep learning and converts the generated caption into speech for accessibility. The system integrates computer vision with a pre-trained image captioning model built using TensorFlow or PyTorch, along with OpenCV for image processing and Tesseract OCR for optional text extraction. The final output is presented both visually and through audio using text-to-speech libraries like pyttsx3 or gTTS. The attached demo video (output_small caption.mp4) illustrates the working of the model, highlighting its ability to generate meaningful descriptions for input images in real-time.
